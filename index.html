                        <h4>About myself.</h4>
                        My task is to become a financially independent person. I think programming can help
                        with this. If we
                        talk
                        about myself, then I can confidently say that I am a purposeful person. I noticed that
                        throughout my
                        life I
                        always give myself a challenge, whether I can or not, and thanks to this quality, I move
                        forward.
                        Therefore,
                        with my studies, I am always on you. After university, I moved to live in Minsk, where I work as
                        a
                        chief
                        specialist in the Department for Supervision of Safe Operations in Industry of the Republic of
                        Belarus.
                        And
                        I
                        decided that it was time to move on and my choice was on programming.
