                <li>About myself. <br>
                    My task is to become a financially independent person. I think programming can help
                    with this. If we
                    talk
                    about myself, then I can confidently say that I am a purposeful person. I noticed that throughout my
                    life I
                    always give myself a challenge, whether I can or not, and thanks to this quality, I move forward.
                    Therefore,
                    with my studies, I am always on you. After university, I moved to live in Minsk, where I work as a
                    chief
                    specialist in the Department for Supervision of Safe Operations in Industry of the Republic of
                    Belarus.
                    And
                    I
                    decided that it was time to move on and my choice was on programming.</li>
                <li>Skills. <br>
                    I am a student at TeachMeSkills programming school. I am studying at the Frond End
                    developer.</li>
                <li>Sample code: const years = prompt('How old are you?', ''); <br>
                    if (years == '' || years == null) { <br>
                    alert('Error. Enter how old are you.'); <br>
                    console.log('Error. Enter how old are you.'); <br>
                    } else { <br>
                    alert('Congratulation to you full ' + years + ' years!'); <br>
                    console.log('Congratulation to you full ' + years + ' years!'); <br>

                    if (years >= 18) {
                    alert('You are an adult!');
                    console.log('You are an adult!');
                    } else {
                    alert('You are underage!');
                    console.log('You are underage!');
                    };
